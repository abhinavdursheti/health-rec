# Personalized Health Recommendation System - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **complete web-based Personalized Health Recommendation System** built with Django and Machine Learning. The system provides AI-powered personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and sleep based on individual user profiles and health data.

## 📋 Project Details

### Goal

### Key Features Implemented

1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Secure login/logout system
   - User profile management

2. **Health Profile System**
   - Comprehensive health data collection (age, weight, height, BMI)
   - Activity level tracking
   - Health goals setting (weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance, wellness)
   - Dietary preferences and restrictions
   - Medical conditions tracking

3. **Diet Recommendations (ML-Powered)**
   - Calculates BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
   - Predicts optimal daily calorie intake using Random Forest Regressor
   - Generates macronutrient distribution (proteins, carbs, fats)
   - Creates personalized meal plans based on dietary preferences
   - Considers allergies and restrictions

4. **Exercise Recommendations (ML-Powered)**
   - Determines fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Uses Decision Tree Classifier for exercise type selection
   - Generates customized workout plans
   - Adapts to user's available time and goals
   - Provides exercise frequency recommendations

5. **Sleep Recommendations (ML-Powered)**
   - Predicts optimal sleep duration using Linear Regression
   - Calculates optimal bedtime and wake-up times
   - Provides sleep schedule based on sleep cycles
   - Offers personalized sleep hygiene tips

6. **Health Data Tracking**
   - Daily weight tracking
   - Sleep hours logging
   - Exercise minutes recording
   - Calories consumed tracking
   - Progress visualization with charts

7. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Real-time health metrics display (BMI, BMR, TDEE)
   - Progress charts (weight trends, sleep trends)
   - Recent health data table
   - Active recommendations display
